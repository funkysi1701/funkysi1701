<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Simon Foster (FunkySi1701)</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Developer based in the North of England, More than just another developer.</h3>

My real name is Simon Foster but my on-line persona is Funky Si a nickname I was given many years ago which has somehow stuck. I am a Developer working in the North of England. I have been working in IT departments for over 13 years and have a wide range of experiences. More recently in the Software Development space but also SysAdmin, Server Infrastructure and DevOps.

In my spare time I have created Pwned Pass a Xamarin Forms mobile app that makes use of the Have I Been Pwned? API to allow searching for breached emails and passwords. This is available from the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords).
